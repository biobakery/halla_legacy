Plan 01-30-14
===============

* Something I have been thinking for a long time but had not the chance to implement: make objects in halla as close to uniformly cast as possible
	+ I use scipy and numpy objects but also write custom objects; make sure to use decorators `@` or wrappers to make sure objects are consistently called 
	+ One use that is definitely useful is the nonparametric p-value generation for various distance metrics. 
	+ Also, writing distance functions that generalize to higher dimensions automatically will be nice.
	+ e.g. `cor(X,Y)` makes sense for 1-dimensional arrays X and Y, but for multidimensional objects?  

* Front end development 
	+ Batchmod development -- command line, presets, reading in files and configuration 
	+ test module
	+ logging module 
	+ Plotting capacities 
	+ browser-based visualization methods 
	+ galaxy module

* Back end dev 
	+ Optimization 
		- Code refactoring
		- C/C++ 
		- Julia?
		- Eventually moving off of R completely; standalone is almost always better 
		than a code hodgepodge
