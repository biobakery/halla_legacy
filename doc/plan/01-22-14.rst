HAllA validation
-------------------
* AUC=~0.8 is more reasonable, see what's generating this problem in validation
* Start with next time
    + Using PCA to generate representatives for each cluster
    + Evaluate both + and - versions of hypothesis testing (ruling in vs. ruling out)
    + Yekutieli works for +, but not -
    + To evaluate -, start with plain old FDR over all hypothesis tests

FDR correction Notes 
----------------------

Yekutieli correction notes 

* Procedure 
    + sort p(i)'s
    + max_i { p(i) <= i/m*q } 
    + reject all j up to i 

* Bounds
    + full FDR_t <= 2 * delta * q 
    + outer node FDR_l <= 2 * l * delta * q 

* Notes from simulation 
    + delta < 1.44 
    + however, for most cases, delta ~ 1 is reasonable.
