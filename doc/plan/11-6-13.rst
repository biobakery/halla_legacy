* HAllA
** Draft
*** Condense Introduction - probably don't need to be that long
**** These are good topics to touch on, but probably not all in separate subsections
**** "Previous work has defined useful generalized measures for high-dimensional data, but not how to use them."
*** Methods - similarity scoring might want its own subsection
*** Results - need to include theory results either at start (for stats) or end (otherwise)
*** Discussion - include summary as first subsection/paragraph
**** Good point to include later on is the combination of parametric + nonparamtric benefits
*** Include the asymptotics/bounds in Results, not Discussion
**** Can recap the importance of these results in Discussion, but need to present them first
*** Results - can pare down applications
**** Microbiome + cancer + malaria are gimmes
**** Survival is a maybe, molecular network we probably don't need
*** Comparison is really key
**** Do this first, make this a priority
**** About two other systems are appropriate for testing against
*** A similar problem framing occurs in Christoph Lange's block linear models
**** Fah worked on BBER, which blocks correlated SNP/gene tests for eQTL analysis
*** Algorithm is right in spirit but needs notation help
** For next time
*** Run this on simple concrete data
*** Show me the data
*** Run a SIMPLE implementation of HAllA using VERY BASIC choices for each option
*** Compare this to something even simpler like Pearson/Spearman correlation
