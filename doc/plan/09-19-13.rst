** Current algorithm:
*** Matrices provided as input
*** Quality control
*** Each matrix hierarchically clustered by MI
*** Minimum similarity threshold chosen for indistinguishable features
*** Starting at the top of the tree down:
**** Compare all pairs of clusters at that level by MI
**** Compute significance by:
***** Permutation test to determine if value is nonrandom
***** Bootstrap (?) to determine if value is (also) unusual in comparison to dataset distribution
**** Stop if ???
***** Geometric falloff (equivalent to repeated tests)?
***** Adapt Yekutieli criterion to hierarchy of data?
***** Test strong negative version of the hypothesis, i.e. no relationships exist below these nodes?
**** Repeat at ~half of the previous tree depth
** Curtis will put in touch with Giovanni's group for consultation
** Goals for next meeting
*** Take over repository
*** Run a demo on a reasonable but small test dataset
*** Have some measurements for timing on large datasets
*** Have a >=1 proposal(s) for our stopping criterion with justification
