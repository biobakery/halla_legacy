* HAllA
** Code comments
*** In discretize, go by quantiles rather than range
*** Don't break doctests - either make sure behavior matches or replace tests
**** python -m doctest <filename.py>
*** For speed, use numpy arrays or blists
** Meet with Emma to discuss CCREPE algorithm + code if needed
** Short term goals
*** Code
**** Organize this more cleanly as Python library + CLI
**** Create reasonable test data and make sure it runs
**** This will probably require a test script that makes well-behaved data
**** Incl. at least random (to test FPs) and one "obvious" association:
/n/home10/chuttenhower/hg/sfle/input/halla/input/
*** Results
**** Compare HAllA with Pearson correlation on a small, homogeneous dataset
***** Continuous values, single set
**** Do the same thing vs. X2 on a small, categorical dataset (binary)
**** How does sensitivity/specificity vary with # features (rows), # samples (columns)
***** Start with random data in both cases - should get results = alpha
***** Add a single spike (in both cases) - plot sensitivity vs. effect size
